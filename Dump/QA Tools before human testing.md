Yes. You can build a **professional QA pipeline for essentially free**. In fact, many startups use free tiers until they grow.

Here's what I'd recommend for ScoutIt.

|Tool|Free?|Best for|Recommendation|
|---|---|---|---|
|**ESLint**|✅|Code quality|⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Required|
|**TypeScript Strict Mode**|✅|Type safety|⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Required|
|**Knip**|✅|Dead files, exports, dependencies|⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐|
|**Madge**|✅|Circular dependencies|⭐⭐⭐⭐|
|**Semgrep Community**|✅|Security|⭐⭐⭐⭐|
|**Lighthouse**|✅|SEO, performance, accessibility|⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐|
|**Playwright**|✅|End-to-end testing|⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐|
|**Vitest**|✅|Unit testing|⭐⭐⭐⭐|
|**Storybook**|✅|Component QA|⭐⭐⭐⭐|
|**Bundle Analyzer**|✅|Bundle size|⭐⭐⭐⭐|
|**npm audit**|✅|Vulnerable packages|⭐⭐⭐⭐|
|**depcheck** (or Knip, which largely supersedes it)|✅|Unused dependencies|⭐⭐⭐⭐|

# My favorite free tools

## 1. Knip ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

This is probably the best "AI cleanup" tool.

It scans your whole project and reports things like:

```
Unused Components
Unused Hooks
Unused Pages
Unused Utils
Unused Types
Unused Dependencies
Unused Exports
```

If you've generated a lot of code with AI, this is incredibly valuable.

---

## 2. Madge ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

One command shows your entire import graph.

It finds:

```
Circular imports

Component A
   ↓
Component B
   ↓
Component C
   ↓
Component A
```

These issues can become painful as projects grow.

---

## 3. Lighthouse ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Run it on every major page.

It scores:

- Performance
    
- SEO
    
- Accessibility
    
- Best Practices
    

For ScoutIt, where search visibility matters, this is essential.

---

## 4. Playwright ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

This is one of the best free testing tools available.

You can automate checks such as:

```
Open homepage

↓

Login

↓

Open property

↓

Create property

↓

Upload image

↓

Search property

↓

Open map

↓

Logout
```

You can even run it across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and mobile viewports.

---

## 5. Semgrep ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Security scanner.

Detects things like:

- XSS
    
- Unsafe APIs
    
- Hardcoded secrets
    
- Dangerous patterns
    

---

# AI-powered (free or limited)

## Gemini CLI ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

If you have a Google AI subscription (which I believe you do), you can point it at your project and ask:

```
Review this entire project.

Find:

- bugs
- duplicated components
- architecture problems
- React mistakes
- inconsistent UI
- bad folder organization
- performance issues
```

It's excellent at reviewing large codebases.

---

## Claude Code (limited)

The free usage is more restrictive, but it's still excellent for reviewing specific folders or features.

---

## GPT-5.5

You can also use ChatGPT for targeted reviews by sharing folders or files, though very large projects may need to be reviewed in sections.

---

# GitHub Actions (Free)

If your code is on GitHub, you can automatically run QA on every push:

```
Push code
      ↓
ESLint
      ↓
Type Check
      ↓
Knip
      ↓
Semgrep
      ↓
Playwright
      ↓
Lighthouse
      ↓
Deploy to Vercel
```

This catches many issues before they reach production.

---

# My "zero-cost startup" stack for ScoutIt

```
VS Code
    ↓
ESLint
TypeScript
Prettier

↓

Knip

↓

Madge

↓

Semgrep

↓

Playwright

↓

Lighthouse

↓

GitHub Actions

↓

Vercel
```

This setup gives you a surprisingly comprehensive QA pipeline without paying for enterprise tools.

## One more tool I think you'd really like: **Biome**

Biome is becoming a favorite replacement for ESLint + Prettier because it's much faster and simpler to configure. If you're starting fresh or don't have a heavily customized lint setup, it's worth considering.

For a solo developer building a large AI-assisted project like ScoutIt, **Knip + Playwright + Lighthouse + Biome (or ESLint) + Semgrep** provides an excellent balance of code quality, testing, performance, and security at no cost.
